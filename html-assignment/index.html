           <arcticle>About me </arcticle>
            <p> My name is Roland Parker I am an international student from the Rebuplic of Liberia.
        It is my first year in Canada, and this my the first year in college. I live in Gatinue city with my Uncle and I take the bus everday to get on campus. I am still new to the bus transport so sometimes I get late for class and sometimes I be there on time but I do my best to be on campus everyday. A motivational quote I like is <q>Doing nothing will get you nothing</q><cite> By my mom.</cite> 
        I am 18 years old born on the 8<sup>th</sup> of <em>June</em> 2007 and I like the H<sub>2</sub>O formula.
