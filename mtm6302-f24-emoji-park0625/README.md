First I accepted the assignment and clone it on my laptop. I added the require files in the repository folder i.e index.htlm,style.css and script.js on vs code. After that I created a section with an id and class to serve as the container for the emoji gallery in the index.html file. In the script.js file, I defined an array of 18 emoji decimal codes and used forEach() to dynamically create and insert HTML elements using the DOM API.
Each emoji was rendered with its corresponding decimal code using innerHTML = '&#' + code + ';' and the layout was achieved using CSS Grid for a responsive structure that adapts to screen size.
