 Roland Parker Web Portfolio
 About the Portfolio
 This portfolio showcases my work as an Interactive Media and Design student. It highlights my projects, skills, and creativity while providing an responsive user experience. The site is designed to be accessible, responsive, and visually appealing, according to modern web development standards.

 The development process for this portfolio involved the following steps:
 I started by going back to all of my User Experience Designs projects i.e
 moodboards, personas, user journey, lofi wireframes, hifi wireframes and etc.

 I used what I created and designed in my User Experience Design Class as a guideline for the entire website. I manage to get a responsive website using Bootstrap and custom CSS. I made sure that the design was clean, professional, and easy to navigate.

 I coded the site using HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript. I used semantic HTML for accessibility and added animations using Animate.css to enhance the user experience.
 I also tested the site on multiple devices and browsers just to be sure that my site was compatible and responsive on all devices and browsers.

 Challenges and Solutions

 Making sure the site looked good on all screen sizes was something that gived me a hard time throughout the whole development. I used Bootstrap's grid system and media queries to create a responsive layout.
 Making the site accessible to users with disabilities was another big challenge too but I was able to used semantic HTML, ARIA roles, and skip links to improve accessibility. I also ensured proper color contrast and keyboard navigation.

 Adding interactive elements like a hamburger menu, making the site logo spins after refresh and etc was very hard to be honest. I used some css transition and Bootstrap for prebuilt components.

 Lessons Learned
 I gained a deeper understanding of creating layouts that adapt to different screen sizes using Flexbox, Grid, and media queries. I also learned how to make a site accessible by using semantic HTML, ARIA roles, and proper focus management.
 I devoted more time to visual studio code and became more proficient in using Bootstrap, Animate.css, and jQuery to enhance functionality and design.

 Assets and Resources Used
 Frameworks and Libraries
 Bootstrap For responsive layout and components.
 Animate.css For animations.
 jQuery  For DOM manipulation and interactivity.

 Creating this portfolio has been a rewarding experience. It allowed me to apply my skills in web development, learn new techniques, and overcome challenges. This project reflects my growth as a developer and my commitment to creating accessible, responsive, and visually appealing websites.
